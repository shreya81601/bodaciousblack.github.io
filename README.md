A clothing website specializing in black clothing lines

<b>PROJECT NAME</b><br>
Bodacious Black

<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>A website for the company <i>Bodacious Black</i> which specializes in Black Clothing lines for Men and Women of all age groups. Bodacious Black Clothes are suitable for a variety of occasions.</p>
<p>The website is built around a video which was made in NYUAD's IM CommLab class as a part of the 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF). The cast in the video can be seen throwing black clothes around and having a lot of fun, hence a black clothing website which uses that as its hype/promo video.</p>
<p>I personally love wearing black clothes and inspired by the cheerful, happy vibe of the video, I wanted to go for a playful, yet subtle theme. Black is the master of colors, especially in terms of clothing bacause it goes with everything and is suitable for any ocassion. It has a certain boldness to it, hence the title 'Bodacious Black'. To bring out this character in my website, I made a very careful choice of colors - Black and Yellow, aolng with shades of beige and grey. The combination of Black and Yellow instantly brings out the bold and happy/playful character in the website, while shades of beige and grey tone that down a little bit and hint at the subtlty of the site. This choice of colors, the layout and the pictures strive to create a look of a highend brand, but a one that is sophisticated and not too elegant to seem very expensive. The site should have an approchable and affordable feel to it.</p>
<p>I hope people who come to this website are able to find the right clothes for themselves and go back happy, just like the cast in the video was overjoyed after receiving their back clothes!</p>

<b>PROCESS</b><br>
I started off with a simple wireframe with a very basic layout (mostly inspired by clothing websites already available on the net but with features and some ideas/elements of my own). The wireframe was a good starting point, but I ended up changing quite a lot based on the requirements and theme of my page. I first created a dummy website in which i tried and tested all tags, elements, links, their usage along with color schemes, font styles and layouts. Once I thought I was nearing the kind of theme I wanted to create, I started finalizing it and transferred the code to my final website folder. First I focused on just getting the main content on the page, then I started styling it. Slowly, as and when required, I started adding additional features like the navigation bar, footer etc. After my website started taking shape, I added other styling effects like drop-shadow, icons and hover interactions to make in engaging and appealing to the eye. After having done my main webpage (index.html), I worked on my sub webpages (the product sections) and finally, linked all the webpages in the end.
